# fix/bear in mind
# problems with cable sensors on net meant mouth of net was skewed, and swept volume will not be comparable with other stations
# winch and scanmar problems; depth strata are wrong (cod ends 2 and 3 were both at 1200 - 1000 m, 4 was 900 - 600, 5 was 600 - 200, 6 was usual 200 - surface)
# MIDOC05: add assumed depths as log data lost 
# MIDOC08: all catch in CE1 
# MIDOC09: CE5 & 6 combined 
# MIDOC12: CE5 & 6 combined 
# MIDOC13: cannot assign valid depths for this station, other than that the max depth was 1022 m.
